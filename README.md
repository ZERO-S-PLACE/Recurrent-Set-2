# Recurrent Set 2

**Recurrent Set 2** is built using **JavaFX** and **Spring Data JPA**. It allows users to generate a recurrent set image for any given equation.

Due to the fact that generating images of recursive sets requires a lot of computation , the application may run very slowly on weaker processors

### Application Features:
- **Image Generation**: Generate recurrent sets for any given equation.
- **Interactive View**: 
  - **Drag to move** the view.
  - **Scroll to resize** the view.
- **Settings and Color Settings**: Store settings and color configurations in MySQL database.
- **Save Views and Equations**: You can save equations and view locations views for later use.
- **Image export**: Application enables to export generated images in **.jpg or .png** in sizes up to **20k x 20k**.
